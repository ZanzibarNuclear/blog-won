# Three Mile Island is Coming Back Online

5-Sept-2024

You may associate Three Mile Island with the biggest nuclear disaster on United States soil. Although that may be true, the claim makes a mountain out of a small hill (bigger than a mole hill, but not that big).

Certainly enough damage occurred in one reactor to require a semi-permanent shutdown. Some day we may have the gumption to clean things up.

But the other reactor continued to function until just recently.

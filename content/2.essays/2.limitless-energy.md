# Nuclear means limitless energy

Humankind already has the means to produce limitless energy without jeopardizing our environment. We have figured out how to split atoms (a.k.a. fission). We are also working on ways to combine them (a.k.a. fusion). We are also improving ways to move electrons with sunlight (a.k.a. solar power).

Of course, we know how to burn stuff, too. While that will help us get by, we can do better.

Nuclear fission is better because it already works at scale, and the byproducts are manageable. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either misinformed or trying to deceive you.

## Don't be fooled.

Use this website to learn about nuclear energy, and the machinery we have already invented to control it to supply the world with abundant energy.

## Code sample

```ts [account.ts]{10-20}
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select(`username, website, avatar_url`)
  .eq('id', user.value.id)
  .single()

if (data) {
  username.value = data.username
  website.value = data.website
  avatar_path.value = data.avatar_url
}
```

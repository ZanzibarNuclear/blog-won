# Productive uses of nuclear energy

Nuclear technology offers immense potential to address some of humanity's greatest challenges. Consider these key benefits:

## Clean and Reliable Power

- It provides stable, round-the-clock electricity not dependent on weather conditions
- Nuclear has one of the smallest land footprints of any clean energy source
- Nuclear power is a low-pollution energy source

## Medical Applications

- Radioisotopes enable lifesaving diagnostic imaging techniques like PET scans
- Targeted radiation is used to treat cancerous tumors while sparing healthy tissue
- Research reactors facilitate the development of new therapies and drugs

## Scientific Discovery

- Neutron scattering allows us to study materials at the atomic level
- Nuclear techniques help date ancient artifacts and map the history of civilizations
- Radioactive tracers shed light on biological and environmental processes

## Sea Exploration

- Nuclear power allows ships and submarines to deploy for long periods of time without needing to refuel
- Nuclear power is better than combustion for underwater vessels.

## Space Exploration

- Radioisotope thermoelectric generators power missions to the outer solar system
- Nuclear propulsion could dramatically reduce travel times for crewed missions to Mars and beyond
- Compact fission reactors may one day provide power for lunar or Martian bases

Nuclear technologies hold immense promise to raise living standards and expand the boundaries of human knowledge.

## Simulations

- [Nuclear Reactor Simulator](https://dalton-nrs.manchester.ac.uk/): Hosted by the Dalton Nuclear Institute, this simulator lets you manage a nuclear power plant’s energy output to meet daily demands. It’s a challenging game that requires strategic planning and decision-making to optimize energy production.
- [Helios](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/helios-game/en/): A Game About How the Sun Makes Energy. This game allows players to simulate nuclear fusion, the process that powers the Sun. Players combine protons and neutrons to create helium, generating energy in the process. It’s an interactive way to learn about fusion while playing a game.

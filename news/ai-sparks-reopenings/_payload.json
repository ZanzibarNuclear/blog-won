In this case, the boost is more of a side-effect of energy-hungry AI. As computers are consuming exponentially growing amounts of electrical juice, data center operators look toward reliable sources of baseload energy.",[10,14,15],{},"So-called \"renewables\" may be wonderful when conditions are right. Bright sunshine at the right angle allows solar panels to flood the grid with electrons. Just the right amount of wind, not too slow and not too fast, and wind turbines might goose the grid for a time. Both of these sources are unreliable.
